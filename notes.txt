React-router

npm install --save react-router@4.0.0

What is react-router?

this just updates the page without loading a new html/php page
this reminds me of mvc but for the front-end

An action is any change that can be made to the applications state
Actions: Payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. 

Actions get dispatched to all reducers, need to have the switch statement fot the action.type in order for the right reducer to handle the right action


Action creators

fetch_posts -> gets a list of posts and serves them to the PostsIndex Component

returns an object, which is the action. Must have a type
for this action creator in order to get the list of posts we need axios to make
the ajax call as well as redux-promise to handle the response

npm install --save axios redux-promise

redux-promise is a middleware


react lifecycle method - there are several of them

The one we are using for the PostsIndex Component is: ComponentDidMount

LOOK UP WHAT A REDUX STORE IS

redux-form

npm install --save redux-form@6.6.3

We are obviously using this package for our forms, I will try to explain step by step what is going on

1st: Import and hook up a reducer from the library in the index.js reducer file. Hook it up to the combineReducers function

for a form the different inputs are all state
